i was using macbook air early 2015 before. It was performing ok since i purchased until 2022. But i started facing unexpected shutdown due to poor battery condition. hence i upgraded to M1 Mac in exchange offer. I got around 18k exchange value which was surprising for me.After i started using this i fell in love with this due to following pros1. Excellent battery life (mora than 12 hours continues usage)2. Excellent performance compared to my previous macbook 2015 model (more than 200% bump in performance i felt)3. Excellent display qualityI did not feel any cons during my usage on past 6 months. Only concern is screen is ultra-fingerprint magnet. You need a cleaning cloth always with you which I am carrying with me all the time with IPA liquid for better cleaning performance. But i did not felt about it compared to the performance it was given. Also fingerprint wont be noticeable if the screen is onI thought of buying a screen card for mac (actually I purchased on amazon) to protect form fingerprint. Luckily it was damaged on transit. After that again I did some research and found lot of articles was saying using screen card will void display warranty of mac and screen card will eliminate the small gap given between the screen and keyboard while it closed which will lead to lid will not close properly or addition pressure will be put on screen while it closed which may damage the screen. Hence, I claimed refund instead of replacement product and purchased IP liquid to clean the screen.If you're a frequent traveler along with MacBook, you may notice keyboard marks on screen which may become permanent if it's not cleaned periodically. So, I purchased IP liquid and microfiber cloth to maintain it. It costs me around 200 for both (250ml vetro power IP liquid in amazon and microfiber cloth from DMART). I believe this will last me at least for a year or 2 which is sufficient for me to get another pair of this cleaning product instead of buying 1000+ rupees screen card. This liquid is useful in cleaning my other gadgets as well also during the Screen card installation on my own with cheaper option available online compared to products available in local market with 200+ rupees which is available online for 100+ rupees

Bittersweet experience
","
This is my first Macbook. I needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -1. It should have long battery life. I should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. This device makes you forget worrying about battery.2. It should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. Imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you've been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it's tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. With Macbook, you open the lid and you're productive already!3. It should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.I was initially skeptical with the 8 GB RAM thing, having experienced how quickly 16 GB fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. Still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn't disappoint.But it's not all perfect. There are multiple issues I faced -1. Using an external 2K 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. The  rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. Having been spoilt by the excellent ClearType on Windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, I have a very bothersome time everytime I wake it up. Dear Apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a ClearType equivalent, it's much needed. Though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. BetterDummy (supports M1).2. The mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. My setup goes like this - Lenovo Q24h-10 connected via USB-C to MBA, one USB port of the monitor's USB hub connected to Lenovo 300 FHD webcam, the other USB port (with support for USB BC spec) connected to an ORICO 4-port USB 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of Dell KM636 connected to the hub. The setup works like a charm with Windows on a Dell Latitude, even with Samsung Dex, but somehow with the Mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it's unusable. Things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other USB C port of the Mac though, via an adapter. They are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor's OSD, and using MOS software on Mac, but the jumpiness is still present.Rating it 5 stars for what it's designed to do.

Pocket rocket this Laptop is
","
I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?

If you're a student go for it .
","
It's a very laptop 💻 but here are some of my observations.Screen: The screen is realy amazing movies watching and whatever task you do like reading PDFs, browsing images etc. It's a pleasant experience to eyes .Battery: Although they claim for 15-16 hours of battery life but in real time usage this has been a lot less than the claimed.On the first initial days I was getting about 8-9 hours of battery life which I guess is still good in this price range .i thought there is any manufacturing defect in my air's battery hardware. But the screen brightness and the task you're performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.On less than 50% brightness and very light task I was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and I'm happy with that .Performance : I'm an engineering student and do a lot of development work . So if you're into development you can blindly purchase it . The productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .Keyboard and Trackpad: This is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. However the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . But it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.Verdict: It's been a month of using this laptop and I'm very satisfied . Will update this review after 2 months.

I have been using the Macbook 13,3 inches for almost a year now. It works extremely fast and is very smooth, the keys are great to type on. Though it has a good software and mostly good hardware, the camera quality is horrible. Its very blocky and the pixels are extremely visible. For the price, you can maybe get a better windows laptop but I have been a hardcore apple fan.Overall, I give it a 4.5 out of 5, it runs extremely smoothly even with multiple windows,tabs,apps etc open. My favourite part is the constant updates that apple provides that always upgrade the features and exemplify the user experience! I hope this helps =D.

Nice product. sleek, nice screen, battery power. first time apple user. can already see the difference in the screen clarity switching from pc. Also battery life is better in mac. I'm finally using the laptop the way its used to function - without cord. my old pc drains so much battery that you need to plug the wire as the day progresses. It has progressively gone worse and now needs a new battery within 4 years of use. I hope mac lasts much longer than that. its a bit pricy though but worth the price. hope it helps

MacBook Air M1 - Outstanding Machine
","
Having used Dell/HP laptops only this was the first Mac experience. Below are the observations:1. Buying from Amazon - Got 5900 off on MRP plus another 6000 through credit card plus same day delivery. Checked the serial number online and its a genuine product. Thanks Amazon.2. User experience - Switches on instantly, very light weight, screen is quad HD and you just cannot take your eyes of this machine. Compared to Windows the Mac experience is very smooth.3. Must say the previous HP laptops I bought had issues with numeric keys not working or taking ages to load and frequent windows patches requiring restarts. With Mac there is no compromise on quality.4. This has 2 ports only. The screen quality and trackpad are so good I ditched my plan to connect to external monitor Dell P2419H and logitech keyboard. Only use a M590 Logitech bluetooth mouse out of habit though one can do without it as well. In fact with this you dont need anything else on your table and can keep it clean.All I can say is having used this Mac its well worth the price and way better than all the Windows laptops in the market. Beware once you use this you would probably not want to touch a windows laptop again.

Thinking of Laptop/Notebook - Don't look further

if you are a person who ever thought of buying a high performance laptop at a great bargain, this is it ! An Apple Mac with alien tech capable of competing with i9 processor at a price of that processor unit alone. Got it with a great discount and exchange price making my choice a bliss.Speed - Amazing - 10/10Finally a laptop which will say ""Bring it On""Sound -  Awesome - 10/10watch a movie an experience apple magic. I felt that surround sound so many times.Display - Kickass - 10/10I was unsure to whether I will like this 13.3)Ease of use - 10/10Get ready to become addicted !Handling - 10/10Light as a feather. You will feel scared almost everytime you take itBattery - Exceptional - 10/10 - Sure that you will miss its charger !I got 17hrs and 15% battery left on one charge over two days..Watched Netflix a lot, Worked like hell, Did lot of heavy lifting like code builds and all, Countless hours of web and what not ! Like I almost forgot where the charger was since I didn't charge it for two days straight.

Writing this review after 3 weeks of purchase. Laptop is brand new and working great. No problem or issues with the performance (run benchmark test), you can easily do multitasking without any lag/delay. Since I am a software developer I tried with 6-7 microservices running side by side on the IDE. All were running smoothly.The battery last long for approx 12-13 hrs of continuous use without shut down.Slightly disappointed with the web cam, it's 720p, but better than other brands with same resolution.Overall a great experience with a great brand. Go for it.

Besides being a beauty and extremely lightweight, this laptop is full of features which put it ahead of all other laptops.1. Battery life - Easily lasts for entire day even with continuous usage. With 4-6 hrs usage, the battery can last for upto 3 days. You dont have to lug the charger everywhere with the laptop.Other laptops dont even come close.2. Speakers- Great surround sound speakers make listening to music/watching movies a great experience/3. Speed - The startup and apps are superfast.

The Macbook Air 2020 with M1 Chip is definitely a great laptop to buy for personal usage. Its a premium quality machine with great aesthetics and immensely powered by the M1 chip. However, I was a bit disheartened when I came to know that lots of applications have blocked the M1 chip and you cannot install them in this machine (like Instagram, Netflix etc). Overall it might look a costly one to buy, but if you are okay with MacOS then this is the best thing that comes in 93,000 INR. Dell XPS with similar configuration is costlier than this. Go check youtube reviews for this machine to know more in details. Its your hard-earned money so make sure you invest in the right stuff.

It's alien technology
","
Pros:-1. It's Superfast. It will feel fast on everything - from bootup, to app opening, to builds etc.2. It's slim. Air has no fan hence it's form factor is even slimmer than Pro.3. It remains cold even during heavy code builds. It's hard to find things which makes it warm actually.4. I have tried several graphics heavy games and they run great without any heat as well5. If you are just browsing with Wifi on, typically it loses 10% battery in 7-8 hours. But it's for Safari browser. It has achieved I guess what people will call power-efficiency nirvana.6. Screen, Sound and Mic quality are awesomeCons:-1. Since it's winters in India now, some people might not like that it doesn't heat up the surroundings2. For longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as Pro; as that's not the load it's optimised for. But ask yourself - whether you are gonna do that at all.3. Camera is 720p and that sucks about every other laptop as well. But Apple has brought some software optimisations which will make it look better4. It doesn't make sound of fan, so you might feel asleep if you are used that to keep track of your ML jobs.Apple started a revolution with this. Go for it, it's worth it.

You have to spend INR 8 to 10K extra on MS office and a port C Hub.
","
Excellent machine! The battery life is better than your mobile phone 8hrs on heavy usage 12hrs on medium and more on just light usage.But you have to spend extra on USB type C Hub for more ports. This is a big draw back and you have to buy MS office separately. Just include it into your budget.Need not to go for 16GB RAM even for video editing or gaming. 8GB works great and there is no heating issue at all, save your bucks. Best among the lot. In today's date M1 processor is the best as per the performance and wattage consumption.I will recommend it.

The upgrade was pretty long overdue. Got at a very good price due to the festive season and got decent exchange price for my 7 year old MCB air 11 inch. Had to spend around 10 K for additional accessories to switch from USB A to USB C, and another 8 K for the new office. So the overall cost of ownership is close to a lakh. This will last for quite a while so every penny worth it.

I am writing this review after a month of purchase. The apple m1 chip makes everything so much better. A lot of people told me that MacBook Air m1 is very close to the pro. Now I see why. The battery life is shockingly too good for an apple device. I use the laptop for browsing, emails, watching content and MS office; all of this runs flawlessly on this machine. The design is beautiful. The photos don’t do justice to the actual gold colour. I brought gold because space grey wasn’t available even after a long wait but I’m glad that happened because this is a rose gold colour and it looks splendid.This machine is worth every penny even without discounts, but if you get it with some credit card discount or good exchange deal like I did, don’t wait at all.

This is my first MacBook. I am not a video editor or software professional. So can speak about the design and overall performance only. It’s good enough for my daily office works and browsing. Only thing I required was office tools like excel, word and PowerPoint, that was not there but I purchased office 365 and managed it. I think response time is pretty more comparing to my previous HP intel i5 10th gen. but overall it’s good looking and very handy. Battery life is excellent no words to say, similarly video clarity and sound is also awesome. Apple was dream for me and now I owned it.

I am not a programmer or a graphic designer but I needed this for coursework and statistical analysis. The battery seems to be everlasting and I charge it once in 2 days and even that is super fast.

It took me a day to get used to it, being a previous Windows user but everyday I discover new hidden features and it’s great. Don’t buy it to show off but buy it for the absolute workhorse that it is.

The speed with which native apps open is amazing, the battery life is fantastic.You will need to spend more money on the right connectors etc, especially if you want a desktop setup. My Thunderbolt 2 monitor has a lot of USB-A ports to connect my mouse and keyboard and all I had to get was the (rather expensive) Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 connector for Rs 4,500 (which I paid for with my Amazon Card cashback). There are no third-party options. Made more sense (given my needs) than spending Rs 6,000+ on a flimsy USB-C hub or Rs 12,000 on a USB-C dock like the Dell D6000. Thunderbolt docks in India are overpriced and unnecessary if you don't need the speed.

Pros:- Battery Life - No other laptop with this form factor comes near to this one.- Performance - With the M1 Chip processor from Apple, Software and Hardware work together like magic.- No Fan for cooling the processor, so super silent.- Compact and lightweight.- Mac OSCons:- Normal limitations related to Mac OS (For example, gaming).Recommendation:The best Apple laptop period.

Don't feel like Apple product

Within a month of the use trackpad stopped working. At that time Apple care told me now it cannot be exchanged/replaced as the replacement window is over. I left with only choice of getting the hardware replaced. Now again within a year same issue, the trackpad has stopped working. Even worst I need to pay for new part this time as the warranty has expired. I bought this for my daughter's study and uage is very minimal. It doesn't seem like using apple product. Feel like cheated!!

Apple has shown his great work in this MacBook with own chip hardware. Apple will change the performance benchmarks from this lineup. Look wise cannot be better than this.

I haven’t had such horrible experience with any of my previous laptops as I am having with this one. The keyboard and trackpad stopped working within 10 days. Amazon wouldn’t replace it since it’s outside their 7 days replacement policy. And Apple won’t replace it since only part replacement is possible under the warranty. Took it to service centre. They didn’t find the problem and simply formatted the laptop and it was working. Although, after 2 days same problem was happening. Called apple support and they asked to format again. On formatting, it is working currently but who knows when I have to format again.

Apple products are unquestionably the best. But, discounts offered can land you with a defective product. I had heard this from retail stores, but, also experienced it. This Rose Gold macbook Air M1 turned out to have current discharge from the body on using it while being plugged to power.Amazon sent someone to verify the problem. Over it was done, there were at least 7-10 calls that i had to do to follow up on replacement. They never replaced it. Instead they finally at the end of one month of follow ups, forced a refund.Overall, it was a distasteful experience.

8gb of ram and 256gb of storage is too less for the price and performance is also okish. the operating system has useless animations everywhere and lacks basic functionality of connecting and transferring files(full access) from iphone and android(you cannot). usb-A port is Unavailable. Adapter is also not bundled.the macOS updates are buggy to the point it becomes unusable with random restarts. heating issues as well.the keyboard is simply trash.this is my first and last macbook purchase.the m1 chip inside is of no use unless you do video editing on final cut pro which you should buy separately.I would suggest to go with a windows laptop which will last you much longer if u have technical know how to get stuff done. you will get full control over your machine and you can install linux operating system after a few years as well.

Affordable high quality laptop (Long term review)
","
Pros:- If you’re switching from an older laptop like I did, the speed of the laptop is going to blow you away. Apple has really broken ground with their processors- Thin and light form factor- QHD screen / Retina Display- The battery life is really good. That’s again thanks to the power efficiency of the M1. I could easily get an entire work day without a charger- Aluminium unibody- Magic keyboard and best in class trackpad- USB C charging point Cons:- Lack of ports and variety does hinder usage. I’m using it with a dock to connect to a monitor, keyboard and mouse- full charge takes time. This is a bummer in the age of fast charging products- can notice the slowdowns when there are too many browser tabs open. Killing some apps resolves this tho- the thin body is a double edged sword. It can flex when under pressure like in a bag. I had to diagonally apply pressure to straighten it.- while the USB C charging point is a boon, the magnetic charging port from older models is missed- 60Hz screen- Subpar cameraI upgraded from a 2013 MacBook Pro to this and I’m not disappointed but yes, there is room for improvement. I cannot do away with MacBooks because of the connected ecosystem and my work flow. Despite the demerits - can score this 4/5.

The only value for money Apple product that exists
","
Apple is not considered for value for money, but this laptop has the most value for money I've ever got. This is a ~1L laptop but it performs better than 2.5-3L laptops. Getting this on a deal is something you won't repent in the next 5-6 years.

Beauty with beast! 💻

Purchased it through apple site.Certainly the best option available if one wants to experience speed.Choose this if you want to experience:- Speed with multitasking- Enhanced battery life (Around 15 hours)- Best in class Design and looks- Superb Display- Easy handling- No fan/heat issuesCons:- Optimization of some Intel apps with M1 chip but manageable.

MacBook ? No please  ! NEVER  ever again !
","
After having been an avid windows user through HP/dell laptops , I too got bitten by the bug of owning an apple product . So went and bought an apple MacBook Air with MI chip in sep 21 . First impressions were : wow , such a beautiful piece , great display , great sound quality etc etc . Needed adjustment to working with a mac after being with windows throughout but saw that as a thing I would eventually overcome . Fast  forward 4 months of usage and despite the extreme delicate handling of the laptop , one fine day without any cause , suddenly the display went off and I started seeing a blank screen . Spoke to apple customer care , was directed to got to the local service centre , went there only to be told that warranty doesn’t hold in this case as the display would fall under accidental damage . Accident ???But when did that happen ?  It neither fell down , neither did I keep anything heavy on it nor did I close it , nor was it being charged at that time !!!! . tried telling this to the service centre , then called up the customer care , shared the pics of the display and asked the same thing again , how can they call it an accident when no accident has happened , Got the best reply ever : Only you know or God knows how it happened . Wow , what a wonderful reply ! Apple is out of it . It’s between you and the grand master now . So what do I do now ? Get the display repaired at a cost of Rs 32,000 .  Wait !  what ? 32 k ?So guys , I have had a very bad experience with the product as well as with the service centre and customer care . I am wary of getting the display  repaired since I don’t know what caused the damage in the first place so what is the guarantee that the repaired screen will not suffer the same damage again .Now I am back to searching for a new HP / dell /Lenovo laptop for myself . Missing the sturdiness , economical maintenance ( a new display in this would cost abt 5k) and the windows interface . Bye Bye MacBook. And thanks to Apple for the worst support and care for their customers .

MacBook Air - This is my first MAC laptop.
","
Alright, I have been a long time Windows User, and I must say that this laptop has been quite amazing. I mostly use this for minor video editing, using my cloud apps, working on my projects, coding and development, and for watching videos and browsing constantly. I had slightly dipped my toe in the Apple ecosystem back in 2020 when I had purchased an Ipad, which became my main computer for web browsing and reading books device. It also made me not use my main Windows computer even less as pretty much 60 percent of my workflow was transferred to my iPad. Now this MacBook has become my main device for basically every computing task I can think of. The typing experience has been stellar, quite simply the best keyboard on a laptop hands down! Also the built quality and the hinge design of this laptop made me feel safe to use this as frequently as I want and for as long as I want.My experience with Windows was on a sharp decline from being quite usable to getting in the way of my productivity. The amount of maintenance that my Windows PC requires was mind boggling, especially towards the end of its life cycle. This laptop was preceded by a computer with an FX 6300 chip and 8 gigs of RAM. So naturally, this was just a massive improvement. This laptop has scored 3 times the score of my previous computer on GeekBench. I can feel that difference in general usability and I personally feel that by daily drivering this laptop I have become a part of a revolution in the computing space. The apps in this mac have never taken more than 5 seconds to boot. Doesnt matter if the app is x86 or an ARM based app, all of them are super optimised. Also almost every general app has a 64 bit version out now so you can have that app in your system regardless. Now I realise that most people who will be buying this laptop are going to be either artists or developers, but even if you are a general user who wants a decent computer to learn stuff on or to use it for spreadsheet or document work, then this laptop is value for money, provided you have the budget for it. However, you do pay the Apple Tax with this product much like you do with every other product that the company has released in the country. If you can get it from US or UK, it is worth getting from there as you will obviously save copious amounts of money and you can also redeem the 1 year of international warranty should the need arise.

Value for money purchase
","
This is one of the best laptop I have used in the recent times. Whatever other positive reviews have stated is totally correct. Best thing about this laptop is that it stays cool no matter what you do. It has the best battery backup out there. I am getting around 14-15 hours on a single charge. The display is top notch with great viewing angles and good brightness levels. The output from speakers is a melody to your ears. I won't say a word about the chip. I think even after m1 pro is released, this would be the one that will sell in numbers because former would cost around 2 lakh in India. Most of the softwares are now available for Aarch64. I am a developer and still haven't installed Rosetta 2. Recommend to use Safari as your daily browser as it saves a lot of battery life and it's blazing fast. Will add a 3 month review after some time.

The M1 obliterates other laptops in price to value comparisons. While it is not necessarily the powerhouse some might claim - it breezes through almost all regular daily use scenarios. It’s well built - has a keyboard that’s miles better than the ones in the past few years, a decent screen - and is possibly one of the easiest macs to recommend. If this fits your budget - and you’re not a heavy gamer or professional video editor or something along those lines - go for this blindly. It’s that good.

So if you are comfortable with the dongle situation and if the softwares you use can run on MacOS, this is the machine to go for. It has a 2K Display and mind blowing battery life. It’s a really good machine to work on. Especially coming from a 2.5kg Gaming Laptop this was a welcome change, you can actually use this like a LAP-top. The lack of fans means you can use it on virtually any surface.Points to note:It has just 2 Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack, so you need to use Accesories with Bluetooth compatibility or a dongle.If you are getting the base model like me, get a secondary storage device. You’ll blow through the 256 Gigs even before you know it.

Bought it at a price of 65k after all discount and laptop exchange. But it's awesome. The only con, which is normal for all apple product,  is connectivity. Need to purchase some more items to make it useable. One more drawback is MS office is not available and so I'm facing some problem.

A premium device for your premium needs. For people coming from Windows background, once you get used to mac, then there’ll be no turning back since the stark difference in speed, performance and experience won’t let you. Timeless design; Futureproof performance; Epic battery life. Apple’s new M1 venture is off to a good start and intel should definitely take a note or two (it’s finally time to move to the ARM architecture processors from the x86 architecture ones. If Apple can pull this out, Intel surely can)
