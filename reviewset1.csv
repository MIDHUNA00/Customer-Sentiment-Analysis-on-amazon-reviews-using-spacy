Pocket rocket this Laptop is
","
I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?

If you're a student go for it .

It's a very laptop 💻 but here are some of my observations.Screen: The screen is realy amazing movies watching and whatever task you do like reading PDFs, browsing images etc. It's a pleasant experience to eyes .Battery: Although they claim for 15-16 hours of battery life but in real time usage this has been a lot less than the claimed.On the first initial days I was getting about 8-9 hours of battery life which I guess is still good in this price range .i thought there is any manufacturing defect in my air's battery hardware. But the screen brightness and the task you're performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.On less than 50% brightness and very light task I was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and I'm happy with that .Performance : I'm an engineering student and do a lot of development work . So if you're into development you can blindly purchase it . The productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .Keyboard and Trackpad: This is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. However the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . But it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.Verdict: It's been a month of using this laptop and I'm very satisfied . Will update this review after 2 months.

Apple is at it again!
","
I have been using the Macbook 13,3 inches for almost a year now. It works extremely fast and is very smooth, the keys are great to type on. Though it has a good software and mostly good hardware, the camera quality is horrible. Its very blocky and the pixels are extremely visible. For the price, you can maybe get a better windows laptop but I have been a hardcore apple fan.Overall, I give it a 4.5 out of 5, it runs extremely smoothly even with multiple windows,tabs,apps etc open. My favourite part is the constant updates that apple provides that always upgrade the features and exemplify the user experience! I hope this helps =D.

Nice product. sleek, nice screen, battery power. first time apple user. can already see the difference in the screen clarity switching from pc. Also battery life is better in mac. I'm finally using the laptop the way its used to function - without cord. my old pc drains so much battery that you need to plug the wire as the day progresses. It has progressively gone worse and now needs a new battery within 4 years of use. I hope mac lasts much longer than that. its a bit pricy though but worth the price. hope it helps

MacBook Air M1 - Outstanding Machine
","
Having used Dell/HP laptops only this was the first Mac experience. Below are the observations:1. Buying from Amazon - Got 5900 off on MRP plus another 6000 through credit card plus same day delivery. Checked the serial number online and its a genuine product. Thanks Amazon.2. User experience - Switches on instantly, very light weight, screen is quad HD and you just cannot take your eyes of this machine. Compared to Windows the Mac experience is very smooth.3. Must say the previous HP laptops I bought had issues with numeric keys not working or taking ages to load and frequent windows patches requiring restarts. With Mac there is no compromise on quality.4. This has 2 ports only. The screen quality and trackpad are so good I ditched my plan to connect to external monitor Dell P2419H and logitech keyboard. Only use a M590 Logitech bluetooth mouse out of habit though one can do without it as well. In fact with this you dont need anything else on your table and can keep it clean.All I can say is having used this Mac its well worth the price and way better than all the Windows laptops in the market. Beware once you use this you would probably not want to touch a windows laptop again.

Thinking of Laptop/Notebook - Don't look further

if you are a person who ever thought of buying a high performance laptop at a great bargain, this is it ! An Apple Mac with alien tech capable of competing with i9 processor at a price of that processor unit alone. Got it with a great discount and exchange price making my choice a bliss.Speed - Amazing - 10/10Finally a laptop which will say ""Bring it On""Sound -  Awesome - 10/10watch a movie an experience apple magic. I felt that surround sound so many times.Display - Kickass - 10/10I was unsure to whether I will like this 13.3)Ease of use - 10/10Get ready to become addicted !Handling - 10/10Light as a feather. You will feel scared almost everytime you take itBattery - Exceptional - 10/10 - Sure that you will miss its charger !I got 17hrs and 15% battery left on one charge over two days..Watched Netflix a lot, Worked like hell, Did lot of heavy lifting like code builds and all, Countless hours of web and what not ! Like I almost forgot where the charger was since I didn't charge it for two days straight.

Apple has shown his great work in this MacBook with own chip hardware. Apple will change the performance benchmarks from this lineup. Look wise cannot be better than this.  However it has sharp edges where paint will eroded first. Battery works with great efficiency in sync of M1 chip. All other things work fine as older generation.

Keyboard and trackpad not working within 10 days
","
I haven’t had such horrible experience with any of my previous laptops as I am having with this one. The keyboard and trackpad stopped working within 10 days. Amazon wouldn’t replace it since it’s outside their 7 days replacement policy. And Apple won’t replace it since only part replacement is possible under the warranty. Took it to service centre. They didn’t find the problem and simply formatted the laptop and it was working. Although, after 2 days same problem was happening. Called apple support and they asked to format again. On formatting, it is working currently but who knows when I have to format again.

Poor experience with product replacement, defective product delivered
","
Apple products are unquestionably the best. But, discounts offered can land you with a defective product. I had heard this from retail stores, but, also experienced it. This Rose Gold macbook Air M1 turned out to have current discharge from the body on using it while being plugged to power.Amazon sent someone to verify the problem. Over it was done, there were at least 7-10 calls that i had to do to follow up on replacement. They never replaced it. Instead they finally at the end of one month of follow ups, forced a refund.Overall, it was a distasteful experience.

Hinge problem exists.
","
I've bought the new MacBook Air M1 about 20 days ago and I have noticed a creaking noise every time I shut the lid down after having it open for a good amount of time. This noise isn't there when I open it and close it immediately though. It only happens when I close the lid after a while. I don't know if this is normal or if I should take it to a service person. I'm also wondering if it would be covered under warranty if there was any problem with the hinge. (It's a new laptop and I have not dropped it or damaged it in any way).

MacBook ? No please  ! NEVER  ever again !
","
After having been an avid windows user through HP/dell laptops , I too got bitten by the bug of owning an apple product . So went and bought an apple MacBook Air with MI chip in sep 21 . First impressions were : wow , such a beautiful piece , great display , great sound quality etc etc . Needed adjustment to working with a mac after being with windows throughout but saw that as a thing I would eventually overcome . Fast  forward 4 months of usage and despite the extreme delicate handling of the laptop , one fine day without any cause , suddenly the display went off and I started seeing a blank screen . Spoke to apple customer care , was directed to got to the local service centre , went there only to be told that warranty doesn’t hold in this case as the display would fall under accidental damage . Accident ???But when did that happen ?  It neither fell down , neither did I keep anything heavy on it nor did I close it , nor was it being charged at that time !!!! . tried telling this to the service centre , then called up the customer care , shared the pics of the display and asked the same thing again , how can they call it an accident when no accident has happened , Got the best reply ever : Only you know or God knows how it happened . Wow , what a wonderful reply ! Apple is out of it . It’s between you and the grand master now . So what do I do now ? Get the display repaired at a cost of Rs 32,000 .  Wait !  what ? 32 k ?So guys , I have had a very bad experience with the product as well as with the service centre and customer care . I am wary of getting the display  repaired since I don’t know what caused the damage in the first place so what is the guarantee that the repaired screen will not suffer the same damage again .Now I am back to searching for a new HP / dell /Lenovo laptop for myself . Missing the sturdiness , economical maintenance ( a new display in this would cost abt 5k) and the windows interface . Bye Bye MacBook. And thanks to Apple for the worst support and care for their customers .

MacBook Air - This is my first MAC laptop.
","
Alright, I have been a long time Windows User, and I must say that this laptop has been quite amazing. I mostly use this for minor video editing, using my cloud apps, working on my projects, coding and development, and for watching videos and browsing constantly. I had slightly dipped my toe in the Apple ecosystem back in 2020 when I had purchased an Ipad, which became my main computer for web browsing and reading books device. It also made me not use my main Windows computer even less as pretty much 60 percent of my workflow was transferred to my iPad. Now this MacBook has become my main device for basically every computing task I can think of. The typing experience has been stellar, quite simply the best keyboard on a laptop hands down! Also the built quality and the hinge design of this laptop made me feel safe to use this as frequently as I want and for as long as I want.My experience with Windows was on a sharp decline from being quite usable to getting in the way of my productivity. The amount of maintenance that my Windows PC requires was mind boggling, especially towards the end of its life cycle. This laptop was preceded by a computer with an FX 6300 chip and 8 gigs of RAM. So naturally, this was just a massive improvement. This laptop has scored 3 times the score of my previous computer on GeekBench. I can feel that difference in general usability and I personally feel that by daily drivering this laptop I have become a part of a revolution in the computing space. The apps in this mac have never taken more than 5 seconds to boot. Doesnt matter if the app is x86 or an ARM based app, all of them are super optimised. Also almost every general app has a 64 bit version out now so you can have that app in your system regardless. Now I realise that most people who will be buying this laptop are going to be either artists or developers, but even if you are a general user who wants a decent computer to learn stuff on or to use it for spreadsheet or document work, then this laptop is value for money, provided you have the budget for it. However, you do pay the Apple Tax with this product much like you do with every other product that the company has released in the country. If you can get it from US or UK, it is worth getting from there as you will obviously save copious amounts of money and you can also redeem the 1 year of international warranty should the need arise.

This is one of the best laptop I have used in the recent times. Whatever other positive reviews have stated is totally correct. Best thing about this laptop is that it stays cool no matter what you do. It has the best battery backup out there. I am getting around 14-15 hours on a single charge. The display is top notch with great viewing angles and good brightness levels. The output from speakers is a melody to your ears. I won't say a word about the chip. I think even after m1 pro is released, this would be the one that will sell in numbers because former would cost around 2 lakh in India. Most of the softwares are now available for Aarch64. I am a developer and still haven't installed Rosetta 2. Recommend to use Safari as your daily browser as it saves a lot of battery life and it's blazing fast. Will add a 3 month review after some time.

There is nothing that I could have asked more from this machine and from the seller “Amazon”I m a programmer and have always relied on beefy systems for my usage. I was a little apprehensive about the machine but went a head as there was a huge discount on the prime day sale on the 16 gig model.So far Im mighty impressed with this machine and to give you a context, I have been using 2019 model MacBook pro 32/1 Tb version for my office. I cant make out any difference in performance between the two and to be honest this one is a silent and compact machine that I prefer over the MacBook pro.A special mention to the battery. I have never seen a laptop give moe then 5 hours of backup while the cpu usage of more then 55%.This is one product which is the most value for money from Apple. Period

The M1 obliterates other laptops in price to value comparisons. While it is not necessarily the powerhouse some might claim - it breezes through almost all regular daily use scenarios. It’s well built - has a keyboard that’s miles better than the ones in the past few years, a decent screen - and is possibly one of the easiest macs to recommend. If this fits your budget - and you’re not a heavy gamer or professional video editor or something along those lines - go for this blindly. It’s that good.
