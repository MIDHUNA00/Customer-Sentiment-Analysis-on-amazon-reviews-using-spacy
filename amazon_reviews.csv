A BRANDED AND AFFORDABLE COMPACT FOR INDIAN SKIN TONE.,"This is a branded yet affordable, matte finish compact powder for daily wear . I found this affordable and effective range of Maybelline Fit Me products during my product research. This Compact Powder pack is available in 6 unique shades. I have a fair skin tone and so I choose to order 330 TOFFEE shades for my skin. The 8 gms powder cake is packed in a beautiful-looking black round box, it has a round sponge applicator and a mirror on the lid. The Maybelline compact powder comes in an easy-to-use and easy-to-carry pack. I got it for a deal price of just Rs.180/- and I am very happy about it. This Compact Powder offers a matte finish and 12 hours of oil control with the goodness of SPF28 PA+++ to give complete sun protection.
I do not like to use a lot of make-up actually and I am not a makeup expert. I use this Maybelline Fit me compact powder over Maybelline Fit me matte plus a poreless liquid foundation of the same shade 330 TOFFEE. This compact powder when applied using the sponge applicator on the liquid foundation, it forms a thin layer giving a natural-looking matte finish. This 330 TOFFEE shade suits my skin tone nicely. Before starting the makeup, I do cleanse my face first and apply a light moisturizer. On that I apply liquid foundation first, I do not use concealer, then I use Maybelline Fit Me Compact powder to layer the skin with a natural and matte finish. The liquid foundation easily covers my dark spots and uneven skin tone with its medium coverage. The compact powder applied over it feels lightweight and offers a comfortable natural matte look for a longer time.",,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 25 April 2023
330 toffee shade..skin tone se bhut match kerta hai,"waise yeh product bhut zyada costly hai but I always usr it and manage to spent this much money cause it is suitable for dusky to dark skin.330 toffee shade is suitable to me..
310 natural color achcha lagta hai lekin smjhne bhi aata hai kuch lagaye lekin 330 toh match hojata minimal make-up jaise..aur fake nahi lagta.",,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 May 2023
